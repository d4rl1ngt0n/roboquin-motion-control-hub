- Ensure data privacy and client isolation

### UI/UX Considerations
- Focus on engagement metrics over financial data
- Prominent visual tracking features
- Clear support request visibility
- Transparent payment processes

## Stakeholder Alignment

### Business Model Compliance
- **No revenue generation focus** - RoboQuin contracts with partners
- **Client pays for rent, not repair costs** - repair payments scheduled after approval
- **Focus on customer engagement** - visual tracking and interaction metrics
- **No financial system integration** - no SAP, ERP, or CRM connections

### Key Differentiators
- **AI-powered features** - positive marketing communication
- **Visual tracking system** - photo documentation of appearances
- **Customer engagement metrics** - interaction patterns and preferences
- **Transparent payment process** - client approval workflow
